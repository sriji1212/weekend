- 7.30 Ye, those who;
   viduh, know;
   mam, Me;
   sa-adhi-bhuta-adhidaivam, as existing in the physical and the divine planes;
  > * all those beings responsible/incharge of certain functions with respect to creation
  * like devata for sun, moon, fire, wind, etc..
  * the truth of all devatas is also brahman
  * brahman is the reality behind any exception
- ca, and also;
   sa-adhiyajnam, as existing in the context of the sacrifice;
  > * those who know that sacrifice is also brahman
  * story of jadabharata
  * whatever thought you have at the time of death will determine what you will be born next - primarily become detached - complete non-attachment
  * only possible if you get rid of ALL desires
  * creating healthy aversion of all desires
  * then mind will not find any reason of going outwards - so automatically mind gets absorbed in true self
  * avoid attraction, absorb with self knowledge
  * even getting attached to pets (dogs) is not good
  * complete detachment
   te, they;
   yukta-cetasah, of concentrated minds-those who have their minds absorbed in God;
  > * people who are not in charge of attachment are free
   viduh, know;
   mam, Me;
   api ca, even;
   prayanakale, at the time of death. [For those who are devoted to God, there is not only the knowledge of Brahman as identified with all individuals and all actions (see previous verse), but also the knowledge of It as existing in all things on the physical, the divine and the sacrificial planes. Those who realize Brhaman as existing in the context of all the five, viz of the individual, of actions, of the physical,of the divine, and of the sacrifices-for them with such a realization there is no forgetting, loss of awareness, of Brahman even at the critical moment of death.
