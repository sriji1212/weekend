- 7.28 But those men of virtuous deeds whose sins have come to an end, and who are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me, steadfast in their vows.
- English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda
  7.28 Yesam jananam, those persons
   tu, on the other hand
   punya-karmanam, who are of virtuous deeds, in whom exist virtuous deeds that are the cause of purification of the mind
   whose papam, sin
   antagatam, has come to an end, is almost eradicated, attenuated
   te, they
   dvandva-moha-nirmuktah, being free from the delusion of duality as described
  > *  joy and sorrow
  *  like a sine curve
  *  ups and down are just appearances
  *  real me is unaffected by anything that happens around me
  *  this can happen only if we can pull ourselves away from desires
    ^^GET RID OF DESIRES^^
  *  create a _healthy_ aversion of desires by contemplating by problems associated with the gaining of desires backed up with knowledge - living a life of karma yoga and pursuing knowledge
   * all desires goes through so much desire and not able to enjoy also
  and drdhavratah, firm in their convictions-those who [Here Ast. adds, 
  'sarva-parityaga-vratena, through the vow of relinishing everything'.-Tr.] have the firm knowledge that the supreme Reality is such alone and not otherwise are called drdhavratah-
   bhajante, adore
   mam, Me, the supreme Self. Why do they worship? This is being answered:
- > having wealth is not punya
  having money is fruitless and binds you in samsara
- next lifetime its disconnected, you cannot withdraw from same bank account
- > punya karma is those who are commited to self knowledge - if you are serious, you can cut all papa - cuttling all connections with punya and papa karma
- they are freed from this moha
- ^^these pairs of opposites does not affect you at all^^
- they worship ME with firm commitment
- they - jijnasu bhakta (who is almost there)or jnani bhakta (who is already there)
- ^^devotee is the natural relationship one can ever have^^ all others are temporal
- ^^i am not different from bhagwan^^ -- #KNOWTHIS
- those people are never distracted - no regret about having done anything, not achieving anything
- no regret for fulfilling any desires
- REACHING endpoint - jeevan mukthi - exchillarating relief you get by not being pulled in any direction, by not being pulled by any desire..
- ^^THIS IS REAL MOKSHA^^
