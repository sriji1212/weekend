  English Translation By Swami Sivananda
  
  8.15 Having attained Me these great souls do not again take birth (here) which is the place of pain and is non-eternal: they have reached the highest perfection (liberation).
  
  English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda
  
  8.15 Upetya mam, as a result of reaching Me who am God-as a result of realizing My nature; mahatmanah, the exalted ones, the monks; gatah, who have attained; the paramam, highest; samsiddhim, perfection, called Liberation; na, do not; apnuvanti, get; this kind of punarjanama, rirth. As to what kind of rirth they do not get, the Lord states its characteristics-duhkhalayam, which is an abode of sorrows, a resort of physical and other sorrows, i.e. a birth to which sorrows adhere. It is not merely an abode of sorrows, but also asavatam, impermanent, having no fixity of nature. On the other hand, those who do not reach Me, they come again. Again, 'Is it that those who attain someone other than You return?' This is being answered:

- Punarjanma is abode of pain, suffering
	- however much we convince that body is enjoyable, is REALLY NOT
		- very ignorant notion
		- pleasure is very very momentarily
			- JOY spread out far - separated by LOOONG gaps
			- ^^MIND TRICKS - like Reunion/alumni meeting^^
				- when we are in the present, there is lot of pain
				- but when we think of that experience in future, you don't feel pain but enjoy the past experience
				- same rt. now in PRESENT, we are in pain and think of FUTURE
				- Mind tricks you that DOING something is JOY
				- but actually BEING who you are  is REAL JOY
