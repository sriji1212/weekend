  _māmupētya punarjanma duḥkhālayamaśāśvatam.
  
  nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ saṅsiddhiṅ paramāṅ gatāḥ৷৷8.15৷৷_
  
  English Translation By Swami Sivananda
  
  8.15 Having attained Me these great souls do not again take birth (here) which is the place of pain and is non-eternal: they have reached the highest perfection (liberation).
  
  English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda
  
  8.15 Upetya mam, as a result of reaching Me who am God-as a result of realizing My nature; mahatmanah, the exalted ones, the monks; gatah, who have attained; the paramam, highest; samsiddhim, perfection, called Liberation; na, do not; apnuvanti, get; this kind of punarjanama, rirth. As to what kind of rirth they do not get, the Lord states its characteristics-duhkhalayam, which is an abode of sorrows, a resort of physical and other sorrows, i.e. a birth to which sorrows adhere. It is not merely an abode of sorrows, but also asavatam, impermanent, having no fixity of nature. On the other hand, those who do not reach Me, they come again. Again, 'Is it that those who attain someone other than You return?' This is being answered:

- Punarjanma is abode of pain, suffering
	- however much we convince that body is enjoyable, is REALLY NOT
		- very ignorant notion
		- pleasure is very very momentarily
			- JOY spread out far - separated by LOOONG gaps
			- ^^MIND TRICKS - like Reunion/alumni meeting^^
				- when we are in the present, there is lot of pain
				- but when we think of that experience in future, you don't feel pain but enjoy the past experience
				- same rt. now in PRESENT, we are in pain and think of FUTURE
				- Mind tricks you that DOING something is JOY
				- but actually BEING who you are  is REAL JOY
- why not let me born again and again if we think life is wonderful?
	- if you really inquire into it, you might not want to come back
- How to gain VAIRAGYA for re-birth
	- life is suffering - life is full of struggle
		- life is not fun as we think we imagine
		- we always hope there is a light at the end of the tunnel
		- HOPE keeps us running
	- thats why dont think of re-birth
	- complete the job here
- Take care of you first
	- others will take care of themselves
		- wife
		- children
		- parents
- Patanjali yoga
	- Dhukka alayam - types of suffering
		- parinama dhukka
			- whenever you accomplish something, you are always worried that that moment will go away... so you hold to it as long as possible
			- discontentment/dissatisfaction on whatever you have achieved
		- thaaba dhukka
			- even while enjoying whatever you have accomplished there are disturbances, like in movie somone talks in mobile/disturbances around
			- just cannot completely enjoy
			- suffering endured to plan the trip - packing, tickets, money etc.
		- samsara dhukka
			- thinking through all suffering you went through in the past (like while enjoying the vacation)
			- like parents telling... remembering/thinking is also suffering
		- guna vrithhi virodha
			- even while you are enjoyingm there is a conflict on what is right and what is wrong and that bothers- some pain due to the conflict
			- unable to focus on the mind as well
- Any activity is PAIN
- So DO NOT wish for REBIRTH
- life is also SHORT - ashasvatham
- Hence develop Vairagya for re-birth
- why one pursues Moksha?
	- to avoid suffering
- One who gains THIS ABSOLUTE knowledge, suffering DOES NOT MATTER anymore
- one has strength to face whatever is the experience
- jeevan muktha - does not even goto Brahma loka
