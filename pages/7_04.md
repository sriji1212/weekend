- _7.4 Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoism thus is My Nature divided eightfold._
-
- 7.4 Iyam, this;
- prakrtih, Prakrti,
	- [Prakrti here does not mean the Pradhana of the Sankhyas.] the divine power called Maya; me, of Mine, as described; bhinna, is divided; astadha, eight-forl; iti, thus:
	- devided into 8 below components
- 1. bhumih, earth;
	- -not the gross earth but the subtle element called earth, this being understood from the statement, 'Prakrti (of Mine) is divided eight-fold'.
	- Similarly, the subtle elements alone are referred to even by the words water etc.
- 2. Apah, water;
- 3. analah, fire;
- 4. vayuh, air;
- 5. kham, space;

- 6. manah, mind.

	-
- 7. buddhih, intellect,
	- is meant the principle called mahat [Mahat means Hiranyagarbha, or Cosmic Intelligence.] which is the source of egoism. By
	- cosmic intelligence
	- generally we understand as individualintellidence
	-
- 8. ahankarah, egoism,
	- is meant the Unmanifest, associated [Associated, i.e. of the nature of.] with (Cosmic) ignorance. As food mixed with position is called poison, similarly the Unmainfest, which is the primordial Cause, is called egoism since it is imbued with the impressions resulting from egoism; and egoism is the impelling force (of all). It is indeed seen in the world that egoism is the impelling cause behind all endeavour.

	-
- vedic model of creation
	- not purely limited to atoms, molecules, sub atomic --> science way --> not wrong and we dont dismiss the scientific way --> limits to what we observe --> what we can "prove" - physical
	- vedas take it to next level, picks up from where science leaves -
		- beyond physical - which cannot be observed -
		- sthula and ssuksma - gross and subtle
			- even these are limited
			- there is something greater than this
	- we study only for the sake to dismiss creation - not to understand the model of creation
	- scientist --> to learn more and more about the creation
	- vedanta --> there is no point to understand creation, as its much bigger
	- applications is relative in the real world
		- like ayurveda is based on this model
		- like our various disciplines are based on this model
