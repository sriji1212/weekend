- English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda
- 7.26 O Arjuna, aham, I, however
   veda, know
   samatitani, the past beings
   and vartamanani, the present. I know ca, also
   bhavisyani, the future
   bhutani, beings. Tu, but
   na kascana, no one
   veda, knows
   mam, Me. 
  Except the one person who is My devotee and has taken refuge in Me, no one adores Me, jus because he does not know My reality. 'What, again,is the obstruction to knowing Your reality, being prevented by which the creatures that are born do not know You?' In anticipation of such a estion, the Lord says this:
- > I know all the people - past, present and future
  I know everything but I dont have company here
  Only I know - no one knows me, or understands me properly
- > for us- ^^only know that we dont need to know everything^^
  its a blessing that we dont know everything
  just live in the present
  
  > for bhagwan its not a problem but only for the human mind
