- 7.1 O Partha,  ^mayi asaktamanah^ , having the mind fixed on Me- one whose mind
- (manah) is fixed (asakta) on Me (mayi)
- who am the supreme God possessed on the alification going to be spoken of-.
- Yogam yunjan, practising the Yoga of Meditation, concentrating the mind-.
- Madasrayah, taking refuge in Me-one to whom I Myself, the supreme Lord,
- am the refuge (asraya) is madasrayah-.
- Anyone who hankers after some human objective resorts to some rite such as the Agnihotra etc., austerity or charity, which is the means to its attainment.
- This yogi, however, accepts only Me as his refuge; rejecting any other means,
- he keeps his mind fixed on Me alone.
- Srnu, hear; tat, that, which is being spoken of by Me;
- as to yatha, how, the process by which; you who, having become thus,
- jnasyasi, will know; mam, Me; asamsayam, with certainty, without doubt, that the Lord is such indeed; and
- samagram, in fullness, possessed of such alities as greatness, strength, power, majesty, etc.
- [Strength-physical; power-mental; etc. refers to omniscience and will.] in their fullness.
