- _7.22 Yuktah_,being endued;
  _ taya_, with that;
  _ sraddhaya, faith_, as granted by Me;
  _ sah_, that person;
  _ ihate_, engages in;
  _ radhanam, i.e. aradhanam_, worshipping;
  _ tasyah, that form of the deity. And labhate_, he gets;
  _ tan hi_, those very;
  _ kaman_, desired results;
  _ tatah, there-from_, from that form of the deity which was worshipped;
  _ as vihitan, they are dispensed_, meted out;
  _ maya eva, by Me alone, who am the omniscient, supreme God, because I am possessed of the knowledge of the apportionment of the results of actions. The meaning his that he surely gets those desired results since they are ordained by God. If the reading be hitan (instead of hi tan), then the beneficence (-hita means beneficent-) of the desired result should be interpreted in a figurative sense_, for desires cannot be beneficial to anyone!
