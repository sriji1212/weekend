- dēvāndēvayajō yānti madbhaktā yānti māmapi৷৷7.23৷৷
- _ English Translation By Swami Sivananda
- 7.23 Verily the reward (fruit) that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The worshippers of the gods go to them, but My devotees come to Me.
- English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda
- 7.23 Since those non-discriminating men with desires are engaged in disciplines for limited results, therefore, tat phalam, that result; tesam, of theirs; alpamedhasam, who are of poor intellect, of poor wisdom; antavat tu bhavati, is limited, ephemeral, indeed. Deva-yajah, the worshippers of gods; yanti, go; devan, to the gods. Madbhaktah, My devotees; yanti, to; mam api, to Me alone. 'Thus, though the effort needed is the same, they do not resort to me alone for the unlimited result. Alas! they are surely in a pitiable condition.' In this manner the Lord expresses his compassion. 'Why do they not take refuge in Me alone?' The answer is:
- > Any desire is limited - time bound
  only permanent is the jeevan mukthi
