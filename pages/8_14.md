  _ananyacētāḥ satataṅ yō māṅ smarati nityaśaḥ._
  _tasyāhaṅ sulabhaḥ pārtha nityayuktasya yōginaḥ৷৷8.14৷৷_
  
  English Translation By Swami Sivananda
  
  8.14 I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me (for a long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single mind or one-pointed mind), O Partha (Arjuna).
  
  English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda
  
  8.14 Partha, O son of Prtha, tasya yoginah, to that yogi; nitya-yuktasya, of constant concentration, who is ever absorbed (in God); and ananya-cetah, of single-minded attention, a yogi whose mind is not drawn to any other object; yah, who; smarati, remembers; mam, Me, the supreme God; satatam, uninteruptedly; and nityasah, for long-. By satatam, uninterrupteldy, is meant 'without any break'. By niryasah, is meant along duration. Not six months, nor even a year! What then? The meaning is: He who remembers Me for his whole life, continuously. To that yogi aham, I; am sulabhah, easy of attainment. Since this is so, therefore one should remain ever absorbed in Me, with mind given to nothing else. 'What follows from Your being easy of attainment?' This is being answered: 'Hear what follows from My being easy of attainment.'
