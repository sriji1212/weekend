- `8.7 Therefore at all times remember Me only and fight. With mind and intellect fixed (or absorbed) in Me, thou shalt doubtessly come to Me alone.`

- 8.7 Tasmat, therefore; anusmara, think of; mam, Me, in the way prescribed by the scriptures; sarvesu kalesu, at all times; and yudhya, fight, engage your-self in war, which is your own (caste) duty. Asamsayah, there is no doubt in this matter; that arpita-mano-buddhih, by dedicating your mind and intellect; mayi; to Me; esyasi, you-you who have thus dedicated our mind and intellect to Me, Vasudeva-will attain; mam eva, Me alone, as I shall be remembered. [When the Lord instructs Arjuna to think of Him, and at the same time engage in war, it may seem that He envisages a combination of Knowledge and action. But this is not so, because when one thinks of all actions, accessories and results that come within the purview of the mind and the intellect as Brahman, it is denied that actions etc. have any separate reality apart from Brahman. Therefore no combination is involved here.] Besides,
- > * keep ME as most important in mind
  * committed your mind and intellect
  * mind not being attracted to all these temporal objects
  * all these pursuits limited in time
  * bhagwan is more importal
  * decision is taken by the buddhi, and holds back the mind in going after something which is not useful
  * `when you know everything as silly and keep less importance to all things around, then time is near to attain moksha`
  * so always favor self knowledge and get rid of attraction, aversion becomes indifference
  * if aversion, there is no possibility of return to desires
  * ^^there is abosolutely no doubt about that - A FACT^^
