- _7.3 Among thousands of men, one perchance strives for perfection; even among those successful strivers, only one perchance knows Me in essence._
-
- 7.3 Sahasresu manusyanam, among thousands, among a multitude of men;
- kascit, a rare one; yatati, endeavours; siddhaye, for perfection.
- [For perfection: for the rise of Knowledge through the purification of the mind.]
- Siddhanam api, even of the perfected one; yatatam, who are diligent-they (those diligent ones themselves) being (considered to be) verily perfect because they are striving for Liberation; of them-;
- kascit, one perchance, indeed; vetti, knows; mam, Me; tattvatah, in truth.
- Having drawn the attention of the hearer by arousing interest, the Lord says:
-
- Clearly says how rare this pursuit is.. one in millions only pursue this
- [[2_25]] -- also had a similar one 11-25 --> atma jnanam - very difficult and rare for someone to completely understand
- 2 reasons why this happens
	- 1. dont know this knowledge exists
	  2. even if you know, you dont have vairagra, dedication to pursue it
	- human being - by default, mind is turned outward
