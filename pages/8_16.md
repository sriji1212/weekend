  māmupētya tu kauntēya punarjanma na vidyatē৷৷8.16৷৷_
  
  English Translation By Swami Sivananda
  
  `8.16 (All) the worlds including the world of Brahma are subject to return again, O Arjuna; but he who reaches Me, O son of Kunti, has no rirth.`
  
  English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda
  
  8.16 O Arjuna, all the lokah, worlds; `abrahma-bhuvanat`,
   together with the world of Brahma-bhuvana is that (place) in which creatures are born, and `brahma-bhuvana` means the world of Brahma; 
  `punah avartinah`, are subject to return, are by nature liable to come again; 
  `Tu`, but; kaunteya, O son of Kunti,`na vidyate` , there is no;  
  `punarjanma, rirth; upetya`, after reaching; `mam`, Me alone. Why are all the worlds together with the realm of Brahma subject to return? Because they are limited by time. How?

- based on karma, going to all lokas upto Brahma loka are round trip
- Only brahma loka is one-way trip
- 6 other lokas higher than earth
	- bhuvaha
	- jananaha
	-
	- sathyaha
- Going to other lokas is also like a vacation - all suffering
- so better is Jeevan Mukthi as going to Brahma loka is tougher
