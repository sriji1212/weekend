- this intelligent design/being is the ishwara according to vedas
- who decides when to heat up for the big bang theory
- then cools down
- someone decides
- all of this needs to be decided by conscious intelligent being
- environment/ ecological
-
- there is nothing greater than superior being than me...
- this is the core of the every object of the creation
- ..and then gives some examples
- from high level, he proceeds to give some examples in the next few verses
