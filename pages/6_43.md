- 6.43 Thee he comes in touch with the knowledge acired in his former body and strives more than before for perfection, O Arjuna.

- 6.43 Tatra, there, in the family of yogis; labhate, tam buddhisamyogam, he becomes endowed with that wisdom; paurva-dehikam, acired in the previous body. And yatate, he strives; bhuyah, more intensely; tatah, than before, more intensely than that tendency acired in the previous birth; samsiddau, for, for the sake of, perfection; kuru-nandana, O scion of the Kuru dynasty. How does he become endowed with the wisdom acired in the previous body? That is being answered:
-
- Like Ramana Maharishi - he was born in a very cultural family but not a spiritual family
	- on one day - he just had a thought of what is life/who am i/what will happen post death
	- then all this knowledge just appeared to him -- because of things he had done in his earlier life times
	- this is 99.999% not common
	- but we need to have an open mind - to **look** for the ^^real answers^^
	- then he had put in all effort towards it **moksha**
