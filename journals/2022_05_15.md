- one who see's me everywhere in the form of "oneness" - that person does not forget me in any activity he/she does
- how does I always keep God in my mind?
	- you see yourselves everywhere
	- you see yourself as non-different from anything in the universe
	- Advaita only talks about this
		- no higher or lower consciousness
		- only ONE consciousness
	- one who appreciates oneself as that chaitanyam
		- ramana maharishi - upadesha saram
- meditate steps
	- 1. body at rest, taking mind away from the body
	  2. focus on breathing, taking mind away from the breath
	  3. once able to restrain, then do chanting  --> to bring back the mind, 
	  4. Goal is to slowly shift to silence between the chants
	  5. once you are able to lock into the silence between the chants, just be there
	  6. goal is to lock yourself into the silence
	  7. once you are able to lock yourself into the silence, you will be able to reconnect it as and when you want
	  8. this is the whole idea of meditation --> not to get some extraordinary "experiences"
- Everything depends on the atma,

- _sukhaṅ vā yadi vā duḥkhaṅ saḥ yōgī paramō mataḥ৷৷6.32৷৷_
-
- Seeing yourself as a reference point, one sees the sameness as everywhere - to see the oneself everywhere in both happiness and sadness
	-
	- the reality of yourself is the reference point for seeing the reality of everywhere
	- oneness is not somewhere, its there with you
	- whatever thought you have is the reference point as well
	-
- keeping balance - in happiness and sadness, in pleasure and pain, you should remember this - able to see yourself in everything
	- when things are not going well, keep aware of this knowledge
	- as you don't get affected by happiness, you should not get affected by sadness
- **hedonic adaptation** - both happiness and sadness doesn't last forever - it is temporary
	- once you understand _vedanta_,
		- you would learn to ignore happiness or sadness
		- unless you are looking for it inside, you can be happy anytime
- such "balanced" yogi is regarded as the "highest" yogi
- Don't allow below to disturb you - **SAMAM** - be same - understand sameness
	- don't allow sorrow to catch hold of you
	- you don't hold to experiential joy

-
- I am unable to lock into the "oneness" because of the wavering of mind
	- I do not see light at the end of the tunnel
	- I do not see any solution
	- how long will I keep doing it?
	- Arjuna is saying becuse, he was also a tapasvi -
		- so he had to do so much tapas
		- he has been trying for so long
		- rt. now he is dejected..

- It drags me forcefully in various directions
- focusing mind is such a problem
- Gita talks about focusing of mind, concentration
	- but that is not the GOAL of Gita
	- focus - goal of concentration

-
- mind that is moving, is extremely difficult to restraint
- but, there are solutions
- 2 requirements
	- 1. abyasa - repeated practice
	  2. vairagya - courage/dedication/absolute resolve/shraddha
	- vairagya towards all my desires -
	- not stubborn vairagya, without understanding..
	- this vairagya is with understanding that all happiness from outside is temporary
		- HAVE TRUST in the process - it will happen
	- give up desperation to acquire more money
