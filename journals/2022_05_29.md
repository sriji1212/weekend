	- We have so many lifetimes
	- This is one of the numerous life I have lived
	- Current lifetime is based on karma accumulated over the past lifetimes
	- For us, we have so many chances - if we don't get it now we will get an opp to get it later
	- Don't look at life as this is the only lifetime and don't need to maximize all fun you need to have
	- 7 desirable and 7 undesirable lokas for different kind of experinces
		- boo loka (earth) is one of the experiences
		- there are many diff
	- look at this lifetime as a means to an end, but not as an end
	- dont go behind comforts etc.. as they are very insignificant in the bigger picture
	- for mumukshu, this lifetime is dedicated for self inquiry
		- all efforts spent for self inquiry pays off later
		- this yogi takes place in a birth of a clean/cultured/rich/yogi family
		- if we have born in such a family its because of "your" karma, not your parents karma - to pick it up the inquiry from there
		- srimatham - not a matrix - ideas/rules which are imposed upon us
			- like even hindutwa - you should not become a prisoner of an idealogy
			- freedom of thinking
