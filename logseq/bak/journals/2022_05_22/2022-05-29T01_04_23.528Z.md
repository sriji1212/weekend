- Undoubtedly - becuase Nature of the mind is to move, but you are making to make it still
- But definitely possible with practice and dispassion
- Vairagya - growing out of one's emotion
	- happiness
	- sadness
	- anger
	- grief
	- surprise
	- excitement
- ultimately we need to grow out of all these emotions
	- even good emotions also need to be get ridden
- vedanta cannot emotionally satisfy/ make you happy - like how social media does
	- only inner joy/inner happiness
	- may be thats why vedanta is unattractive
	- it is supposed to be dry
	- truth is supposed to be dry
	- does not evoke emotion
	- if it evokes emotion, then it can be only short lived
	- if truth also becomes an emotionally object, then that also will be short lived

	- For one who is not prepared, it is very tough to achieve
	- Krishna says - i know this for sure
	- but it is not impossible
	- just you need to start moving in this direction
		- by proper means and being one being in-charge of himself
	- goal is clearly stated - it is achievable but certainly tough
	-
	- lets say- from now, one should not be affectionate with closed ones
		- in fact, we are trying to find love - eternal need
		- but its impossible
		- how much preparation is needed to understand this
	- upatatah - by right means / right kind of effort / views - sadhana requirements
		- shravana - listening
		- manana
	- vasyatmana - one who is incharge of himself
	-
	- we cannot wake up one day and suddenly have vairagya
	- mind control -
	- success is also an emotion - we need to get rid of success as well

- _6.37 Arjuna said He who is unable to control himself though he has the faith, and whose mind wanders away from Yoga, what end does he, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, mee,t O Krishna?_
-
- O krsna, aprapya, failing to achieve;
- yoga-sam-siddhim, perfection in Yoga, the result of Yoga, i.e. full Illumination;
- kam gatim, what goal; gacchati, does one attain; who, though
- upetah sraddhaya, possessed of faith, belief in God and in the other world; is
- ayatih, not diligent, devoid of effort on the path of Yoga; and, at the time of death, too,
- calita-manasah, whose mind becomes deflected;
- yogat, from Yoga, (i.e.) whose memory has been lost?

	- 6.38 Mahabaho, O Mighty-armed one;
	- ubhaya-vibhrastah, fallen from both, having fallen from the Path of Action and the Path of Yoga;
	- apratisthah, without support;
	- vimudhah, deluded-having become deluded;
	- brahmanah pathi, on the path of Brahman, on the path leading to Brahman;
	- kaccit na, does he not;
	- nasyati, get ruined;
	- iva, like; a
	- chinna-abhram, scattered cloud? Or is it that he does not?
