_nātyaśnatastu yōgō.sti na caikāntamanaśnataḥ._

_na cātisvapnaśīlasya jāgratō naiva cārjuna৷৷6.16৷৷_

- _Yoga is neither for him who eats too much; nor for him who totally abstains from eating;_
- _nor for him who is prone to sleep too much; and nor for him who keeps awake too much._

  - 1/2 food + 1/4 water + 1/4 air
  - no eating like no tomorrow
  - how solid food we take is directly connected to our thoughts
    - solid : contributes to thought process
    - liquid :
    - heated : 

  - moderation in the amount of sleep as well
    - 6-7 hrs

_yatrōparamatē cittaṅ niruddhaṅ yōgasēvayā._

_yatra caivātmanā৷৷tmānaṅ paśyannātmani tuṣyati৷৷6.20৷৷_

- _Where the mind, well-restrained through Yoga-practice, remains iet; again where, observing, by the self, nothing but the Self, he (Yogi) is satisfied in the Self;_

  - where, one is seeing oneself (not as in physical seeing) by oneself by mind 
  - appreciating your true self, you are satisfied with yourself
  - everything happens because we are conscious (atma is there)
  - all the trouble of getting rid of the ignorance is to understand yourself, 
  - pursuit of knowledge is also to be absorbed in the absolute joy
