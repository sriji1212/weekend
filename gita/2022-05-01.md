- breathing also helps to get away from unwanted thoughts
- avoiding social media also helps
- completely give up on desires
- in this lifetime (atleast at 65-70), dont look at stock market!
- stop external and start internal
- don't judge yourself, don't aim perfection, at same time don't become complacent as well.. BALANCE is the key
- keep working, very deligently and constantly
- 
## memory
- memories are not different from dream
- present alone is the real
- truth of the present
- 

## buddhi
- very discriminating
- decides which one to attach and one to detach based on experience/knowledge
- anything viral in social media "celebrates" pain - all emotional stuff etc.. try to disengage from pain as vedanta completely dismisses pain
- disassociate from pain - even when you stuggle with pain, only way to make pain illegitatmate..
- **use** buddhi to gain this knowledge and **surrender** to this knowledge... let the knowledge take over and take care of all these

## persistent 
- be persistent and determination - dont ask why it is taking so long
  - don't think of anything else
  - just focus on the process, not the end point
  - have trust that it works as it has worked for so many people
- will happen when you are focused on atma., on yourself
- dont think of anything else
- never judge yourself
- never compare yourself
  - others can do better/ have better.. just don't compare
- comparison is a curse
  - group of people 
    - ppl telling "i have gone deep into meditation"... just for improving self image
    - just don't let that get into your mind
    - this leads to competition and jealously
    - don;t allow that to creep in to your meditation

- how to focus mind?
  - whenever mind wavers/moved away, bring it back
  - this is where breathing helps - helps focus back on the mind
  - mind just jumps from one topic to another... 
  - **TIP** the bud at the beginning itself
  - whenever mind moves away, then artght at that moment bring it back
  - _**when when, then then**_
  - be in charge of your thoughts
- just breathing - focus on the tip of the nostril
- no need for any complex pranayams
- no gender given to "mind"
- this needs to be done relentlessless, diligently, without stopinng
- you need to crack that techniue - way of being incharge of yourself to mind
- once you know the fundateaksm east to absrorb
- thats why starting old gets burbnt out
- nothing should trouble you once you understand gita
- everything we do is designed tomove ibn this direction
