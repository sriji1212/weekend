- there is no happiness greater than this

- just remaining as is
- living an ethical, moral and disciplined lifestyle is mandatory
- person who is not busy all the time, not looking outward all the time
- lifestyle is not

 - yogi getting rid of
    - all unmoral, unethical, free from sins, corrupt etc.

    - remove agnyana


## meditation

- diving deep into meditation, etc... ==> are just a flowery expression 
- when you go into meditation, at certain point you will be able to dismiss all the thoughts, and be peacefully yourself
- we just need to be ourselves and **lock** into ourselves
- when you are one with nature, being into ourselves and just being there..
  - at certain point - you will just forget seeing nature as well.. you be there 

## coming back always

- when thought goes somewhere, coming back as fast as possible

_sarvabhūtasthamātmānaṅ sarvabhūtāni cātmani._

_īkṣatē yōgayuktātmā sarvatra samadarśanaḥ৷৷6.29৷৷_


- once locked in
  - you see yourself in everything / you exist in everything
  - you see everything in you / everything exist in you
- this is what you experience when you can get rid of everything
- all of us experiece freedom of thoughlessness at various times
- but when recognixe, we happened to recognize only after the thought
  - like when we wakeup, only then we recognize that we woke up
- once you open the lock and get in, you cannot lock yourselves out
  - due to ignorance, we are locked ourselves out - 
    - key to open the lock, is only knowledge

## multiverse - not in veda

- like Dr. Strange - not just one reality but multiple realities
- in Veda, it tells you are the only reality
- there is no separate reality

_yō māṅ paśyati sarvatra sarvaṅ ca mayi paśyati._

_tasyāhaṅ na praṇaśyāmi sa ca mē na praṇaśyati৷৷6.30৷৷_

- once you see everything in you and me in everything
- when you appreciate this, and know this
  - you cannot lock yourselves out
- if I give too much reality to the world, you get bothered by world events
- idea is --> don't give too much reality to the world
- relative destruction
  - when we go to sleep, we are unaware of the world - temp. we need to get up
  - it is temp
- then there is higher level of destruction, when whole universe is destroyed
  - this is also a cycle
- but when you lock into the real self, then it is the reality
  - even when you cognitively understoon, you just cannot go back to old ways
  - when logically, analytically analysed and understanding that you are the truth of the whole universe
    - you just cannot forget all what you learned so far
    - sometimes we might feel like why we came to vedanta

_sarvabhūtasthitaṅ yō māṅ bhajatyēkatvamāsthitaḥ._

_sarvathā vartamānō.pi sa yōgī mayi vartatē৷৷6.31৷৷_

- once locked in, this knowledge is always available 
- i am everywhere, i am all persuasive, i am

## you don't need to be successful to be happy
### you can be happy without **anything**

- don't attach money to the happiness
- what os the real self 
- how you can connect yourself

- in fact you will lose interest in all the rat race
  - why I was ignorant all this while

- even if not desperate, there would be still some limitation like not courageous to leave 
  - understand you are on the right path, it will happen if you are into in
  - like train/brake is applied before hand to stop
  - you have to start applying the brake and it will stop..
  - same way you have to start to stop being desperate, stop being ignorant, etc..
